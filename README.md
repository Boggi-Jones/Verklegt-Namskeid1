Project done at the end of first semester in University of Reykjavík.

In this project we were supposed to make a car rental company with all of the including parts. We were also supposed to split it into UI, Logic and Database areas.

Skarphéðinn: Mostly worked on the logic but also helped the other places a lot in figuring how we set it up and connect all parts. Also took a very active role in the meetings.
